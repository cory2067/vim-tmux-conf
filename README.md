# vim-tmux-conf
my .vimrc and .tmux.conf

tested with tmux 3.1b, may break with older versions

there is stuff for plugins, but they're commented out by default cuz sometimes they can be annoying

# Install
run `./install` from within this directory to create symlinks to .vimrc and .tmux.conf

run `./install --copy` to copy files instead of symlinking
